### Step 2: Create a Resource Group
```bash
az group create   --name myResourceGroup   --location centralindia
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Machine
```bash
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVM \
  --image Ubuntu2204 \
  --size Standard_B2ats_v2 \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```
### Step 4: Verify the VM Creation
```bash
az vm show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --output table
```

### step 5: Connect to the Virtual Machine
```bash
ssh azureuser@<public-ip-address>
```
### Step 6: Clean Up Resources VM, resource group
```bash
az vm delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --yes
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```
